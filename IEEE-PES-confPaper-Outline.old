\section{Introduction}
Should cover:
the reason for using deadbands, 
Kou example of how simulating deadbands is important but typically ignored,
deadband considered in transient stability time frame, not long-term,
possible real life benefits of improved deadbands
there doesn't seem to be a valve movement metric, instead some `power hours' calculation is used.

\section{Implementation of Deadbands}
NERC suggestions for droop and deadband

\subsection{Types of Deadbands}
intentional vs unintentional
None, step, no-step, non-linear droop.
and equations for calculating

\subsection{ERCOT Experience}
Improved freq deviation (elimination of `flat top' effect) 2012 
creation of TRE-BAL-001...

\section{Explanation of Simulation Technique}
Why not use transient stability for this study?
Explain time-sequenced power flows.
Explain assumptions and simplifications.

\section{Simulation Validation}
Should a more noise based example be used?
