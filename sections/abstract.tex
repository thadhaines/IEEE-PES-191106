%Simulation of governor deadbands is typically ignored, however, deadband settings can greatly affect valve travel.
%A long-term dynamic simulation method is presented and validated against an industry standard transient simulator.
%Thirty minute simulations are conducted using a reduced-order WECC system model and resulting valve travel and system frequency are compared.
%NERC deadband recommendations are shown to reduce valve travel if adopted interconnection wide, but may increase the valve travel of machines in a system with only partial adoption.

This paper investigates the impact of governor deadbands on valve travel using a novel long-term dynamic (LTD) simulation software environment. 
The Python based LTD software utilizes a commercial power-flow solver to execute a sequence of power flows that is shown to capture long-term power system dynamics with acceptable accuracy.
While classic transient stability simulation is sufficient for investigating the impact of governor deadbands on primary frequency response, LTD software is needed for analyzing the impact of governor deadbands on fuel valve travel over longer periods of time. 
The presented LTD software enables simulations from tens of minutes to hours on full system base cases. % this feels about half right 
%of much longer duration than classical transient stability simulation  -- 
Cumulative valve travel is proposed as a metric for evaluating the impact of various deadband settings.
It is shown that use of specific governor deadband settings can actually increase cumulative valve travel over what would be expected without a deadband.
