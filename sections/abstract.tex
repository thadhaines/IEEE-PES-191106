Simulation of governor deadbands is typically ignored, however, deadband settings can greatly affect valve travel.
A novel long-term dynamic simulation method is presented and validated against an industry standard transient simulator.
Thirty minute simulations are conducted using a reduced-order WECC system model and resulting valve travel and system frequency are compared.
NERC deadband recommendations are shown to reduce valve travel if adopted interconnection wide, but may increase the valve travel of machines in a system with only partial adoption.
