This paper investigates the impact of governor deadbands on valve travel using a novel long term dynamic (LTD) simulation software environment. The LTD software wraps a commercial power flow solver within a Python ODE solver to execute a sequence of power flows capturing long term power system dynamics. The software enables simulations of much longer duraion than classical transient stability simulation  -- from tens of minutes to hours on full system base cases. While classic transient stability simulation is sufficient for investigating the imact of governor deadbands on system frequency response, the LTD software is needed for analyzing the impact of governor deadbands on overall steam/water valve travel over longer periods of time. Cumulative gate valve travel is proposed as a metric for evaluating the impact of various deadband settings and AGC algorithms. It is shown that widespread use of governor deadbands can actually increase cumulative valve travel over what would be expected without deadbands, or with so-called nonlinear deadband settings.
