\section{Conclusion}
This work demonstrates that deadband configurations play a large role in dictating valve travel.
Counterintuitively, a step deadband can lead to vastly increased valve travel compared to other, more linear, options.
Smaller deadbands, as recommended by NERC, can reduce valve travel and help regulate frequency if adopted interconnection-wide.
If only partial adoption of recommendations is made, machines with smaller deadbands will respond more than machines with larger deadbands.[MKDNOTE: I want to talk about this statement.]
Further, this work demonstrates the need for a simulation environment that can capture long-term power system dynamics with appropriate static and dynamic models. The `sequence of power flows' approach to long term dynamic simulation is shown be be most useful. Future work in this area will focus on using the cumulative valve travel metric to study and optimize various governor and AGC control strategies.

%However, in a system with a variety of deadbands, machines with smaller deadbands will respond more than machines with larger deadbands.
%This creates an uneven distribution of valve travel in a system.
%Therefore, if smaller deadbands are to be applied, they should be done interconnection wide to avoid unintentional inequalities in valve travel and associated machine wear.
