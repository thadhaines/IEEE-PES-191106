\section{Conclusion}
Deadbands play a large role in dictating valve travel.
A step deadband can lead to vastly increased valve travel compared to other, more linear, options.
Smaller deadbands can reduce valve travel and help regulate frequency.
However, in a system with a variety of deadbands, machines with smaller deadbands will respond more than machines with larger deadbands.
This creates an uneven distribution of valve travel in a system.
Therefore, if smaller deadbands are to be applied, they should be done interconnection wide to avoid unintentional inequalities in valve travel and associated machine wear.
