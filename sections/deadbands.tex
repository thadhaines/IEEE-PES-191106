\section{Implementation of Deadbands}
In the western interconnect, NERC suggestions for droop and deadband are typically 5\% and 36 mHz respectively.
However, practical implementation is left to generator operators.

\subsection{Types of Deadbands}
Fig. \ref{fig: deadbandType} presents governor response to no deadband and three different implementations of deadbands that follow NERC suggestions.
If a governor has no deadband, a change in output power is requested for any frequency deviation.
A step deadband ignores any frequency smaller than the setpoint $\pm db1$ and then steps to meet the 5\% droop curve.
A no step deadband pushes the original droop curve away from the nominal frequency allowing for the droop curve to cross zero at $\pm db1$.
A non-linear deadband linearly increases from $\pm \alpha$ to $\pm \beta$, after which it follows the original droop curve.
