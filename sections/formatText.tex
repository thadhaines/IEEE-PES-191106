\section{Testing of Format}
% This section meant to see if the template actually does the things

Figures will behave as Fig. \ref{fig: test}. Note that the placement may seem random, but is chosen by \LaTeX\ automatically.
\begin{figure}[!t]

The default table example leaves something to be desired that is fulfilled by using the \verb|booktabs| package.
This is shown in Table \ref{tab: test2}.
\input{tables/IEEEtableTest}

References are only included if cited. For instance \cite{Kundur} or \cite{DonnellyVoltageControl} are randomly cited. Note that the sorting order is set to \verb|none|, which lists references in order cited.

Equations are entered as one may normally do in a \LaTeX\ situation and referenced as (\ref{eq: ACE}).
\begin{align}
\text{ACE}_{\text{tie line}} &= P_{gen} - P_{load} - P_{\text{sched interchange}}\\ \label{eq: TLace}
\text{ACE}_{\text{frequency bias}} &= 10B(f_{\text{actual}}-f_{\text{sched}})f_{base}\\
\text{ACE} &= \text{ACE}_{\text{tie line}} -\text{ACE}_{\text{frequency bias}} \label{eq: ACE}
\end{align}
