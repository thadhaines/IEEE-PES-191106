\section{Introduction}
Deadbands are commonly implemented in turbine speed governors to prevent a machine from responding to small frequency deviations that are ever present in electrical systems.
Industry usage of deadbands is widely known, however, it is often overlooked in power system simulation.
\cite{kou2016} details how incorporating governor deadbands into transient simulation models can lead to results that better match measured power system events.


mish mash intro thoughts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item deadband simulation considered in transient stability time frame, not long-term
	\item \cite{nercFRI2012} reports frequency profile improvement caused by no step deadband. Also uses MW-min calculation to state smaller no step deadbands reduce movement, calls for immediate dev of gov guidelines - led to standard TRE BAL-001 for ERCOT - in full effect april 2015. Most Recent Report \cite{nercFRAA2018} has odd ERCOT frequency probability - more U shaped, less normal.
	\item transient simulation not meant for long term simulation
	\item long term dynamic simulation software focusing on governor dynamics doesn't exist
\end{itemize}
