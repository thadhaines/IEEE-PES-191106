\section{Introduction}
Deadbands are commonly implemented in turbine speed governors to prevent a machine from responding to small frequency deviations that are ever present in electrical systems.
Industry usage of deadbands is widely known, however, it is often overlooked in power system simulation.
XXXrefKou2016 details how incorporating governor deadbands into transient simulation models can lead to results that better match measured power system events.



Additional intro thoughts:

deadband considered in transient stability time frame, not long-term,

possible real life benefits of improved deadbands

there doesn't seem to be a valve movement focused sim option... 

Transient stability software is not meant to run for extended periods of time.

The resolution of data is orders of magnitude greater than is desired (ms v s).
