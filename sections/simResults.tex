\section{Initial Results}
30 minutes of random load noise was applied to the system where every governor in the system had an identical deadband.
Each type of deadband shown in Fig. \ref{fig: deadbandType} was simulated.
An experiment was also conducted to explore partial acceptance of the NERC recommendations presented in \cite{nercFRI2012}.
While PSLTDSim can model AGC, it was not enabled for these simulations.


\subsection{System Modifications}
The miniWECC system was modified to include three areas for simulation.
PSLTDSim was used to set all area governor deadbands to 5\%.
Governors were removed from some units so that only $\approx$20\% of generation capacity in each area has governor control.
%A generic AGC routine that filters area control error (ACE) through a proportional-intergal (PI)  controller was added to each area.
%AGC messages are sent select generation units with governors representing $\approx$9\% of total generation capacity every 15 seconds.

\subsection{System Noise Injection}
Noise was injected into every load in the system according to
\begin{align}
P_{L} &= P_{L}(1 \pm N_Z Rand) \label{eq: noise}
\end{align}
where $N_Z$ represents the maximum amount of random noise to inject as a percent,
and $Rand$ is randomly generated for each load as a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.
The decision to add or subtract noise is chosen by another randomly generated number.
As shown, (\ref{eq: noise}) creates random walk behavior in load value as this is more representative of real life power systems\cite{AGCCresap}.


\subsection{Noise Simulation Results}
30 minutes were simulated where $N_Z$ was set to 0.03. 
The noise added system loading is shown in Fig. \ref{fig: systemLoading} while Fig. \ref{fig: sysFreqDB} shows the resulting system frequency for each type of deadband.

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig: valveComp} a step deadband sends a step input to the governor valve when system frequency is oscillating near the deadband. These control pulses greatly increase valve travel over the more linear methods.

Table \ref{tab: valveTravel} summarizes the valve travel for each generator in the system over the entire 30 minute simulation.

\subsection{Universal Acceptance Simulation Results}
To test partial acceptance of NERC recommendations, all area deadbands were set to the no step variety, but two of the three areas had a deadband of 16.6 mHz while the third deadband was 36 mHz.

As expected, Fig. \ref{fig: areaValveTravel} shows that the area with a larger deadband doesn't respond while the other areas with a smaller deadband do.
