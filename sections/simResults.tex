\section{Case Study}
Explanation of simulations to do...

30 minutes of noise with various deadbands and resulting valve travel.
Cases of intterest:
No deadband, step deadband, no-step deadband, nl-droop deadband.

Universal acceptance sim:
At least 1 area with a step deadband, others with linear or no deadband.
Should show unequal distribution of valve travel.

\subsection{System Modifications}
The system was modified to include three areas for AGC simulation.
PSLTDSim was used to set all area governor deadbands to 5\%.
Governors were removed from some units so that only $\approx$ 20\% of generation capacity in each area has governor control.
A generic AGC routine that filters area control error (ACE) through a proportional-intergal (PI)  controller was added to each area.
AGC messages are sent select generation units with governors every 15 seconds.

\subsection{Simulation Results}
To verify desirable AGC control operation, a simple 1500 MW generation loss event was simulated.


Noise tests, valve travel movement, table inputs, etc.
