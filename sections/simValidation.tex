\section{Simulation Validation}
To validate the chosen simulation approach, identical system perturbances were performed in the GE Energy Positive Sequence Load Flow (PSLF) Dynamic Subsystem (PSDS) and PSLTDSim.
%The output data was then compared in MATLAB.
Bus frequency and governed generator mechanical power data presented is from a 400 MW load step and 400 MW 40 second load ramp that start at simulation time 2.
Mechanical power is compared as it is the closest available state to valve travel recorded in PSDS.

To compare frequency data from PSDS to LTD, a single weighted frequency based on generator inertia was calcualted using (\ref{eq: f_weighted}).
\begin{align}
f_{w} &= \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i \dfrac{H_{PU, i} M_{base, i} }{H_{sys}}  \label{eq: f_weighted}\\
\text{where } H_{sys} &= \sum_{i=1}^{N} H_{PU, i} M_{base, i}  \label{eq: Hsys}
\end{align}

% This explanation may be unnecessary for IEEE...
Due to the different time steps, when calculating the difference between PSDS and LTD, multiple PSDS values have the same \emph{held} LTD value subtracted from them. For instance, any PSDS(t = 3.x) would have the LTD(t = 3) value subtracted from it for comparison.

\subsection{The MiniWECC System}

The power system used for validation and valve travel experiments, the miniWECC shown in Fig. \ref{fig: miniWECC}, is a 120 bus 34 generator system created in PSLF.
All governors in the miniWECC are modeled with the tgov1 which enabled easier validation.
Further details about the creation and use of the miniWECC may be found in ...

\subsubsection{Load Step Results}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig: stepFcomp}, all individual PSDS frequencies begin to oscillate after the perturbance while the weighted PSDS frequency appears to follow the general center of oscillation. The LTD system frequency is less oscillatory than the weighted frequency with only minor differences between the two. Fig. \ref{fig: rampFdif} quantifies these differences.

When comparing mechanical power output in Fig. \ref{fig: stepPmdif}, large MW differences can be seen, however, the percent difference data in Fig. \ref{fig: stepPmPercentdif} shows results less than 5\% max difference, and an average percent difference of less than $\approx$0.5\%.

\subsubsection{Load Ramp Results}

Ramp perturbance results, in Fig. \ref{fig: rampFcomp}-\ref{fig: rampPmdif} show frequency of LTD being within 1.2 mHz of PSDS and mechanical power differences of less than $\pm$10 MW or 1\% difference max (0.2\% average).
%*** Ramp results are included for now, but may be take up much space... They do function as a `better' validation...
